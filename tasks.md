# Sealed — Active Tasks

## Pre-Launch Blockers

- [x] Dropbox Sign end-to-end wired: testMode env-driven, signatureStatus synced on send, declined webhook handled
- [ ] Replace Stripe stub with real payment link generation when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set
  - File: `apps/api/src/modules/invoices/invoices.service.ts`

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Audit state-transition POST endpoints (`/accept`, `/reject`, `/void`) for correct HTTP status codes (should return 200, not 201)
- [ ] Remove compiled `.js` and `.d.ts` artifacts from source history; add to `.gitignore`
